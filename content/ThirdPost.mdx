### Test Heading

### 1. Create a Nextjs app ,with the command of your choice.

In this case we are using npm as the package manager so the command
would look like this:

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

### 2. Installing next-mdx and other relevant packages

To handle mdx files in the Nextjs app , you have to install `@next-mdx` package along with some additional packages:

```
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx
```

### 3. Configuring next.config.mjs file.

After installing the packages,you have to make some changes to the next.config.mjs file so that your Nextjs app can recognise
the `mdx` file format.

```
import createMDX from '@next/mdx'

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Configure `pageExtensions` to include markdown and MDX files
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
  // Optionally, add any other Next.js config below
}

const withMDX = createMDX({
  // Add markdown plugins here, as desired
})

// Merge MDX config with Next.js config
export default withMDX(nextConfig)
```

### 4. adding mdx-components.tsx file.

After modifying the next.config file, you need to add the `mdx-components.tsx` file. This file is essential for the functioning
of the mdx blog.

```
import type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'

export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
  return {
    ...components,
  }
}
```

### 5. Installing gray-matter

In order to process the metadata in the mdx files,you need a package called `gray-matter`.

```
npm install gray-matter
```

### 6. Installing the tailwind typography plugin.

Tailwind css provides a ready made plugin to style the markdown content. It is called `typography by tailwind`. Install this plugin
with the following command:

```
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

Also add this plugin to the tailwind.config.ts file,like this:

```
 plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/typography")],
```
