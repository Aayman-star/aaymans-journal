The code I was using to fetch all blog posts from the directory. This code is working okay,but got an upgrade with the
addition of a **featured** category to be displayed on the main page.

```
/**blogPosts is an array of posts which is filled conditionally.
if the query variable has a value,
the posts are filtered based on that value,
else all posts are fetched from the directory and then sorted with
descending dates.**/

  const blogPosts: Post[] = query
    ? getFilteredPosts(query).filter((post) => post.publish)
    : getAllPosts()
        .filter((post) => post.publish)
        .sort(
          (a, b) => new Date(b.date).getTime() - new Date(a.date).getTime()
        );
```
