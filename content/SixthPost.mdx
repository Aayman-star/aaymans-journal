So recently I watched a tutorial by [ByteGrad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7JCnfbETPs) on youtube. It covers the basics of
nextjs app creation with a simple fullstack blog app.
For newcomers it is a good source to start with. I personally knew a lot of the stuff covered in the video but I got to practice and
polish on the loading and suspence concept in react and nextjs.
So Nextjs provides a `loading` file feature that runs before the page is rendered,but this runs for the entire page. This means
that the available data is also stalled until the missing part of the information is fetched. In simple words the
static portion of the page is also kept from being rendered until the dynamic portion is available.
React has a concept of `Suspense`,which works on component level. This helps nextjs to create a `streaming` setup,where static
parts of the page are rendered while the remote/dynamic parts are being fetched.

Nextjs server actions were also discussed. Server actions are a new approach for backend functions. Generally in the app router
We have to create an api folder and write the backend functions in the route.ts file. But with server actions the need for the
api folder is eliminated. You just have to create an `actions.ts` file with the statement `use server` on top.**`use server` does not
turn the component into a server component,it is used for server actions.**
server actions give you the freedom of creating backend functions with different names,and provide direct communication with the
database.You can say that **server actions** are a way to provide the client with direct communication with the database without
passing through the api folder gateway.
